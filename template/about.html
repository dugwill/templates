        Welcome to the Comcast SCTE-35 Signal and Video Alignment Monitor.<br>
        This is a proof of concept tool. It should not be considered stable<br> 
        and is subject to frequent outages for updates and testing.<br>
        <p>
        For questions, or feature requests, please contact:
        <a href="mailto:douglas_will@cable.comcast.com">Douglas Will</a><br>
        </p>
        <p>
        This tool is intended for use within Comcast.  Do not share it outside of the company.<br>
        Currently this tool is only monitoring DAI enabled linear IP/HTTP streams.<br> 
        I am exploring the addition of mulitcast support in a future release.<br>
        </p>
