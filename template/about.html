        Welcome to the Comcast SCTE-35 Signal and Video Alignment Monitor.<br>
        This is a proof of concept tool. It should not be considered stable<br> 
        and is subject to frequent outages for updates and testing.<br>
        <p>
        <p>
        At this time, the monitoring tool is only looking at the output of Pillar, the IP stream packager.<br>
        There are only 59 streams that are enabled for ad insertion via Pillar (~36 networks, with East and West Coast feeds).<br>
        This is a prototype tool and should not be used as a final determination of ad alignment.<br>
        It should only be used as a guide for taking a closer look at a particular stream. <br>       
        </p>

        <p>
        This tool is intended for use within Comcast.  Do not share it outside of the company.<br>
        Currently this tool is only monitoring DAI enabled linear IP/HTTP streams.<br> 
        I am exploring the addition of mulitcast support in a future release.<br>
        </p>
