        Welcome to the Comcast SCTE-35 Signal and Video Alignment Monitor.<br>
        This is a proof of concept tool. It should not be considered stable<br> 
        and is subject to frequent outages for updates and testing.<br>
        <br>
        What you will see on this tool is the SCTE-35 signals and video frames from the network feeds<br>
        with an indication of where the splice should take place (according to the SCTE-35 signal).<br>
        The system creates 4-5 splice points for each break.  The first point (listed at type 54) is the <br>
        point were the splicer will begin to insert ad content.<br>
        The other splice points (listed as Type 55) come at 30, 60, 90 and 120 seconds after the type 54.<br>
        (The signal at 30s is rare).  These are oppurtunites for the splicer to cleanly switch back to the <br>
        network feed. For a scheduled one minute break, the splicer will switch at the Type 54 and first type 55.<br>
        There is no ad insertion in this tool so you will not see ad content.<br>
        The times for the SCTE-35 signals are in the form of "Mon_Day_hhmmss.ss" and all times are GMT.<br>
        <br>
        As it was inteneded to support the VDE Project, the monitoring tool is only looking at the output of Pillar,<br>
        the IP stream packager. This is after VACT makes any alignment changes, so those changes should be reflected here.<br>
        <br>
        There are only 59 streams that are enabled for ad insertion via Pillar <br>
        (~36 networks, with East and West Coast feeds). So the scope is limited for now.<br>
        I am exploring the addition of mulitcast support in a future release.<br>
        <br>
        This is a prototype tool and should not be used as a final determination of ad alignment.<br>
        It should only be used as a guide for taking a closer look at a particular stream. <br>
